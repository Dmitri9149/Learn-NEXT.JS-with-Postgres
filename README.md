The application is for learning Next.JS , Vercel, Postgres.   

The app helps to select dog breed.

At the moment only the ```dashboard``` path is working, something like:   
```
localhost:3000/dashboard
```

The starter code is from here:   
[course curriculum](https://nextjs.org/learn)

For demonstration purposes I use some dog breed features as in the   
[American Kennel Club](https://www.akc.org/)


The dog picture was taken from: https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/hand-drawn-golden-retriever-silhouette_158856301.htm#fromView=keyword&page=1&position=1&uuid=c2bfcc9c-9526-483f-a8ad-58f563dd3b8e

See the: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/60173 if you will face the "Type error: Cannot find module '@/app/ui/fonts' or its corresponding type declarations."
